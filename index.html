          WHO defines rare disease as often debilitating lifelong disease or
          disorder with prevalence of 1 or less, per 1000 population.
          <ul type="square">
            <li>
              More than 7000 rare diseases have been identified globally out of
              which 450 have been reported in India.
            </li>
            <li>
              About 350 million people world wide suffering from rare diseases.
              If all the people with rarer disease lived in one country, it
              would be the world third most populous country.
            </li>
            <li>
              Approximately 50% of the people affected by rare diseases are
              children.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rare diseases are responsible for 35% of death in first year of
              life.
            </li>
            <li>
              About 30% of children with rare diseases will die before reaching
              their fifth birthdays.

            <li>
              Rare diseases are genetic and thus are present throughout the
              person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear.

              More than 7000 rare diseases have been identified globally out of

            <li>General population lacks awareness about rare diseases.</li>
            <li>
              Drugs are mostly not available, and even if they are, they are
              prohibitively expensive.

            <li>
              ROI for research and development (R&D) of a rare disease and its
              curative drug is not promising.
            </li>

              Lack of sufficient funding from government and pharmaceutical
              industries.

              <b>Rare Disease Day</b> is an observance held on the last day of
              February to raise awareness for rare diseases and improve access
              to treatment and medical representation for individuals with rare
              diseases and their families. The European Organisation for Rare
              Diseases established the day in 2008 to raise awareness for
              unknown or overlooked illnesses. According to that organization,
              treatment for many rare diseases is insufficient, as are the
              social networks to support individuals with rare diseases and
              their families; furthermore, while there were already numerous
              days dedicated to individuals with specific diseases (such as
              AIDS, cancer, etc.), there had previously not been a day for
              representing those affected by rare diseases. In 2009, Rare
              Disease Day went global as the National Organization for Rare
              Disorders mobilized 200 rare disease patient advocacy
              organizations in the United States while organizations in China,
              Australia, Taiwan, and Latin America also lead efforts in their
              respective countries to coordinate activities and promote the day.
